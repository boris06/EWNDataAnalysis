## Introduction

This application is a simple example of the analysis of the oceanographic data collected in the Slovenian sea in the period 1979-2013. The data were measured using a research vessel at four stations named 000F, 000K, 00CZ and 00MA at depths of 0, 5, 10, 15, 16, 21Â¸and 24 m. Using this application the user can view the time series of the individual variables, the associated linear trend in time, and the regression between the chosen variables.

## Usage

### Tab "Data Range"

Here we select the desired station and depth. We may select the option "all" for all stations and/or depths. This selection then applies for both the "Time Series" and the "Regression (see the associated tabs).

### Tab "Time Series"

Here we choose a variable in order to show the data and their linear time trend.

### Tab "Regression"

Here we display the scatter plot between two selected parameters (variable(x) on the x axis and variable(y) on the y-axis). By clicking on the "Simple linear model" button we obtain the results of the linear model that shows the dependence (regression) of the variable(y) on the variable(x). By clicking on the button 'Best linear model" we start a stepwise search of the subset of regressors which form the best linear model for the variable(y).

Note: The stepwise search of the best linear model is possible only for the variables that have less than 25% of missing values. Otherwise, we get an error message.
